- The implementation of a hierarchy to represent a message that can be encrypted using Caesar's encryption, and two sub classes: PlaintextMessage and CiphertextMessage, one encrypting and the other decrypting their message respectively. 
- The goal is to decrypt story.txt

**CAESAR CIPHER**
- The idea of the Caesar Cipher is to pick an integer and shift every letter of your message by that integer.
- Suppose the shift is k. Then, all instances of the i-th letter of the alphabet that appear in the plaintext should become the (i+k)-th letter of the alphabet in the ciphertext.
