# Math Interpreter

### The Program:

The user is prompted for an arithmetic expression.  
The expression is calculated and the result is outputted as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.   
It is assumed that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z.

**DEMO:**

```
$ python interpreter.py
What is the arithmetic expression? 1 + 1
2.0
$ python interpreter.py
What is the arithmetic expression? 4 / 3
1.3
```
