- In the 'normal' version of the game, letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.
- In the 'withComputer' version, the computer can play as well.

The scores are awarded as per Scrabble scores.
